# Disease Prediction System

A machine learning project to predict diseases based on user-reported symptoms. This model is designed to provide a preliminary diagnostic aid by suggesting the most likely conditions.

## üìù About The Project

This project uses a machine learning model trained on a dataset of common symptoms and their associated diseases. The system takes a list of symptoms as input and returns the top 3 most-likely predictions along with their confidence scores.

The core of the project is a Jupyter Notebook (main_medical_diagnosis_nb.ipynb) that details the data cleaning, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps. An accompanying Python script (APP.py) is in progress ["Webpage using streamlit in progress"].

## ‚ú® Features

* Predicts potential diseases from a list of symptoms.
* Provides the Top 3 most likely conditions.
* Displays the confidence percentage for the primary prediction.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* Python
* Scikit-learn
* Pandas
* Jupyter Notebook
* etc

Follow these steps to get a local copy up and running.

### Prerequisites

You must have Python and Git installed on your system.

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    sh
    git clone [https://github.com/isha822/Disease-prediction-system.git](https://github.com/isha822/Disease-prediction-system.git)
    
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    sh
    cd Disease-prediction-system
    
3.  Install the required Python packages:
    sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
   

## USAGE

You can interact with the project in two main ways:

### 1. Explore the Notebook

1.  Launch Jupyter Notebook:
    sh
    jupyter notebook
    
2.  Open the main_medical_diagnosis_nb.ipynb file (it might be in the notebooks folder).
3.  Run the cells to see the entire process from data loading to model prediction.
